  [deiferni]


1.2.4 (2014-07-17)
------------------

- Backport from jquery.recurrenceinput.js:
  Fix a condition, where the ``startdate`` string literal was checked, if it's
  an instance of ``String``, which returned False. This led to the case, where
  the list of occurrences wasn't shown. String literals should be checked
  with``typeof`` instead of ``instanceof``.

  [thet]


1.2.3 (2014-05-06)
------------------

- Integrate latest changes from plone.formwidget.recurrence, which fixes an
  issue introduced with last version, where the recurrence overlay couldn't be
  opened with plone.formwidget.datetime based start fields on Dexterity
  objects.
  [thet]


1.2.2 (2014-04-24)
------------------

- plone.app.widgets support: Let the z3c.form widget's get_start_field method
  prefer 'name' attribute over the 'id' attribute. Looks like, with
  plone.app.widgets the rendered input field doesn't have an 'id' attribute any
  more. Also, integrate lates changes from jquery.recurrenceinput.js, which
  also handles 'name' attributes when trying to get the start field from the
  surrounding form.
  [thet]

- Register plone.app.jquerytools dateinput JavaScript for the 'default' bundle.
  plone.app.widgets registers it for 'deprecated', but we need it here and it
  can peacefully coexist with the new pickadate.
  [thet]


1.2.1 (2014-03-27)
------------------

  evaluation if the "and" path test evaluates to False. Really fixes #10.

----------------

- Fix Problem in AT based widget with a wrong first_day offset, where it didn't

    "Edit..." [thet]
  - Remove ambiguous recurrence rule checkbox, which lead to UX confusion due
    to double negation (unchecked checkbox said "no recurrence rule") and add
    instead a "Delete" button. [thet]

  [deiferni]


1.0b11 (2013-08-23)

  keep it in Python code. More appropriate z3c.form class hierarchy for the
  widget. Cleanup.
  [thet]

- Provide a RecurrenceField schema field which can be used instead of
  zope.schema.Text. This ensures that the recurrence widget is used even
  without form schema hints in bare z3c.form forms.

- Let occurrences preview show the correct daynames and not by one day off.
  Fixes https://github.com/plone/plone.app.event/issues/69
  [thet]

- Configure ributtonExtraClass with 'allowMultiSubmit'. This prevent Plone's
  warnings against clicking the same submit button multiple times. There is no
  need to customize the FORMTMPL anymore when updating the javascript from
  jquery.recurrenceinput.js.
  [thet]

- Make first_day parameter also configurable for AT and z3cform widgets.

  [dokai]


1.0b3 (2012-03-12)
